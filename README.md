# DNSCHK (pronounced "dns check")

Lordy, these aren't ya grandparents' checksums! `DNSCHK` is a low-overhead security layer built on top of DNS that uses checksums to ensure the integrity of files downloaded over the web in an automated and non-interactive fashion.

The research and development behind DNSCHK was a joint effort by [team members](#meet-the-team) from University of Chicago and Walter Payton College Preparatory High School.
